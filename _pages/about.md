Hello, this is Qihan Wu. I'm a 5th-year Ph.D. student at [Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences](https://pbs.jhu.edu), Johns Hopkins University. My advisor is [Jonathan Flombaum](https://pbs.jhu.edu/directory/jonathan-flombaum/). I am interested in object perception and visual cognition.

Visual Illusions
======
I designed and created various visual illusions. I think visual illusions can tell us a lot about how humans see the world and how their mind works. They are also fun and cool to look at. See some of the visual illusions I created in 'Demo'.

**Motion Silencing**
One visual illusion that I mostly work on is called motion silencing. My work shows that it is not caused by things moving two fast, rather it is an attribution error (i.e., difficulties in attributing color to dot's location).

The perception of beauty
======
I am interested in the perception of beauty. 

The dimensionality of beauty
------
One fundamental question about perception is how many numbers (dimensions) are needed to fully describe it. For example, color is three-dimensional, area is two-dimensional, and length is one-dimensional. How many numbers are needed to describe beauty?
