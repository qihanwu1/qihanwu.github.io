I am currently an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering) at [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/). Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), working closely with [Prof. Lei Xing](https://med.stanford.edu/xinglab.html) and [Prof. Matthew Lungren](https://profiles.stanford.edu/matthew-lungren). I have received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), under the supervision of [Bloomberg Distinguished Professor Alan Yuille](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/). I received my B.S. degree from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huazhong_University_of_Science_and_Technology), and M.S degree from [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). I also interned at Google Cloud AI and Google Brain. 

My research interests span in the fields of medical image computing, computer vision, and machine learning, especially the intersection of them. My ultimate research goal is to make medical AI systems more reliable to deliver transparent and trustworthy solutions in the face of the more complex real-world clinical settings. [Here](https://yuyinzhou.github.io/yuyin_zhou_dissertation.pdf) is my Ph.D. thesis.

<span style="color: red;">I am looking for multiple self-motivated PhD/interns to work on machine learning, computer vision and AI for healthcare. Welcome to drop me an email with your CV and publications (if any). </span>

<span style="color: red;">Due to the large amount of emails I receive, I may not be able to respond to each one individually. </span>
