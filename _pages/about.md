I am currently an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering) at [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/). Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), working closely with [Prof. Lei Xing](https://med.stanford.edu/xinglab.html) and [Prof. Matthew Lungren](https://profiles.stanford.edu/matthew-lungren). I have received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), under the supervision of [Bloomberg Distinguished Professor Alan Yuille](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/). I received my B.S. degree from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huazhong_University_of_Science_and_Technology), and M.S degree from [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). I also interned at Google Cloud AI and Google Brain. 

Our group is focusing on advancing biomedical artificial intelligence, primarily in the field of medical image analysis. Our ultimate goal is to match medical experts in decision-making. Specifically, we focus on: 1) creating innovative and cutting-edge medical multimodal model; 2) building real-world learning systems that ensure fair, trustworthy and real-time feedacks to clinicians, caregivers, and even patients; 3) one-shot/few-shot adaptation of open foundation models; 4) synthetic data generation aligned with clinical knowledge.


<span style="color: red;">I am looking for multiple self-motivated PhD/interns to work on machine learning, computer vision and AI for healthcare. Welcome to apply from [here](https://grad.soe.ucsc.edu/admissions) and drop me an [email](mailto:yzhou284@ucsc.edu) with your CV and publications (if any). </span>

<span style="color: red;">Due to the large amount of emails I receive, I may not be able to respond to each one individually. </span>
